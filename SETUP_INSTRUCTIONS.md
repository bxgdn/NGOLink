# Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the NGO & Volunteer Matching Platform up and running.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Convex account (free at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev))

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Set Up Convex Backend

1. Install Convex CLI globally (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g convex
```

2. Initialize and deploy Convex:
```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project (or link to existing)
- Deploy your backend functions
- Generate a deployment URL

3. The CLI will display your deployment URL. Copy it!

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your Convex deployment URL:
```
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
```

## Step 4: Initialize Default Data

Once Convex is running, you can initialize default achievements by opening your Convex dashboard and running:

```javascript
// In the Convex dashboard Functions tab, run:
await ctx.runMutation(api.achievements.initializeDefaultAchievements, {});
```

Or you can wait for the first user to sign up, which will trigger the initialization automatically.

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

In a new terminal (keep `npx convex dev` running in the first terminal):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Step 6: Test the Application

### Create a Volunteer Account
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose "Volunteer"
4. Complete the onboarding process

### Create an NGO Account
1. Open an incognito/private window
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Choose "NGO / Organization"
5. Complete the organization setup
