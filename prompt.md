A multi-select checklist for technical skills (e.g., Web Development, Graphic Design, Content Writing), soft skills (e.g., Public Speaking, Event Management, Mentoring), and interests/causes (e.g., Environment, Animal Welfare, Education, Human Rights).

Ability to add custom skills.

Availability Settings:

Specify hours per week they can commit.

Select preferred days/times.
